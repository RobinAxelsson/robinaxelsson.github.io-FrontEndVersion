Login service,
trial and error with okta

**end of day**\
Managed to embed Okta in my page with some rearrangement of the given method calls. Login and logout works but needs to be manually refreshed at the moment. This is marked as an ISSUE in GitHub. Could work by using an event from oktaLogin-object.

JavaScript starts to get long - session of refactoring and improving comments needed.
